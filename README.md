# interplanetary
================

Package `interplanetary` provides IPFS bindings for Go.

This package is developed outside of go-ipfs To allow for rapid development, this package is being developed outside of the main `go-ipfs` repository. Once the API stabilizes, these bindings may be merged in and this repo deprecated.
